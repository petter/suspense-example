# React Suspense Example

This repository showcases how loading is traditionally done in a react application and how it can be simplified using Suspense.

The application is split into three parts:
- **traditional-simple**: which showcases a bare minimum way of handling loading,
- **traditional-production**: which shows how loading is usually handled in a production-grade environment, and
- **suspense**: which contains the example of handling loading with Suspense
